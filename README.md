## 🌟 Inspiration: More Than an App, It’s Your Digital Soulmate
Traditional journaling is a "silent record"—it captures cold facts but loses the *soul* of the moment. We realized that people don't just need a record; they need a **Soulmate.** Someone who hears the subtext of their voice and resonates with the emotion in their photos. 

**MindBeat** was born from this yearning for connection. We envisioned an AI that doesn't just process data but **"vibrates"** with your soul, turning the chaotic "Life Beats" of your day into a soulful, private masterpiece on your Google Calendar.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Multimodal Capture:** Record your day via Text, Photos, and Voice.
- **Gemini 3 Intelligence:** Advanced emotional reasoning that distills raw data into catchy pop hooks.
- **Musical Timeline:** Automatic synchronization with **Google Calendar**.
- **Privacy-First:** Your data stays within your personal Google ecosystem.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- **Intelligence:** Gemini 3 Flash (Multimodal AI) via Google AI Studio API.
- **Backend:** Google Apps Script (Serverless Orchestrator).
- **Integrations:** Google Calendar API & Google Sheets API.
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, and Web Speech API.

## 🚀 Challenges We Overcame
- **The Token Battle:** Mastering complex Thai linguistics within strict Gemini token limits.
- **Latency vs. Soul:** Optimizing multimodal processing to feel "instant" while maintaining artistic quality.
- **The Soul Alignment:** Heavy prompt engineering to ensure genuine empathy and avoid "toxic positivity."

## 🧠 What We Learned
Building MindBeat showed us the true power of the **Google Ecosystem**. We were stunned by **Gemini 3’s** emotional intelligence and how **Google Apps Script** can act as a professional-grade engine for complex AI suites.

## 🔮 What's Next?
1. **From Lyrics to Melodies:** Integrating with **MusicFX** for actual audio generation.
2. **Biometric Inspiration Sync:** Integrating with **Google Pixel Watch & Fitbit** to trigger musical prompts based on heart rate.
3. **The "Soul Map" Dashboard:** Visualizing long-term emotional trends via **Looker Studio**.
